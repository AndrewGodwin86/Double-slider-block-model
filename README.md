Double-slider-block-model
=========================

Program simulating the double slider block model, a proposed earthquake modelling technique.

This program is a JavaScript port of the original FORTRAN 95 program I wrote for my dissertation at Newcastle University in 2009.

The well known floating point calculation problems in JavaScript have meant that exact replication of the original results is not possible, but the chaotic behaviour can still be observed.
